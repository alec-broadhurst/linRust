# linRust

**linRust** is a matrix math library written in Rust. It provides essential matrix operations and functionality with a focus on performance, simplicity, and complete dependency-free implementation.

## What is linRust?

**linRust** is designed to handle fundamental matrix operations, including:

- Matrix creation
- Addition and subtraction
- Transposition
- Naive multiplication

The library supports any numeric type that implements basic arithmetic operations and is built entirely using standard Rust, with no external dependencies.

## Goals for Future Development

**linRust** is a work in progress with the following goals:

- **Enhanced Performance:** Optimize matrix operations and add support for more efficient algorithms.
- **Extended Functionality:** Introduce advanced operations such as determinants, solving linear systems, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Develop comprehensive documentation and practical examples to help users get started and fully utilize all features.
